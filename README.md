# WiFi-signal-audit
WiFi signal audit in Python
This code allows you to continuously measure and display the Wi-Fi signal strength using the PyWiFi library. Here are some potential uses of measuring the signal strength in cybersecurity:

Wi-Fi Network Analysis: By continuously monitoring the signal strength, you can identify any fluctuations or anomalies in the Wi-Fi network. 
Sudden drops in signal strength or significant variations could indicate potential interference, unauthorized access attempts, or the presence of rogue access points.

Detection of Unauthorized Access Points: The code scans for available Wi-Fi networks and retrieves their signal strength. 
By comparing the signal strengths of known and authorized networks with the detected networks, 
you can identify any unauthorized or rogue access points that may be present. 
This helps in detecting potential security threats or unauthorized network access.

Network Optimization: Monitoring Wi-Fi signal strength can help optimize network performance and coverage. 
By analyzing the signal strength in different areas or at different times, you can identify areas with weak signal coverage, 
potential dead zones, or areas prone to interference. 
This information can be used to adjust the placement of access points or optimize network configurations for better security and performance.

Security Audits: Measuring and documenting Wi-Fi signal strength as part of security audits provides a baseline for assessing network security. 
It allows you to identify areas with weak signal coverage that could potentially be exploited by attackers. 
It also helps in assessing the effectiveness of security measures, such as signal encryption, access controls, and intrusion detection systems.

Intrusion Detection: The continuous monitoring of Wi-Fi signal strength can be integrated with intrusion detection systems. 
Deviations from expected signal strength patterns can trigger alerts or actions, indicating potential unauthorized access attempts or network compromises.

Physical Security Assessments: Wi-Fi signal strength measurements can be used to assess physical security risks. 
By analyzing the signal strength outside the premises, you can determine the range at which the network might be accessible, 
helping in identifying potential risks such as signal leakage or unauthorized access attempts from nearby locations.

Overall, the code provides a means to monitor and analyze Wi-Fi signal strength, 
which can assist in detecting security threats, optimizing network performance, conducting security audits, and enhancing overall Wi-Fi network security.
